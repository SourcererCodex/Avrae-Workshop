# Short Rest with Warlock Multiclass Support
This Alias utilizes the `!sr` alias and adds the function for Warlocks to multiclass and the game keep track of their Pact Magic vs Regular Spellcasting

## Goals
- [x] Track Usage of Pact Magic vs Regular Spellcasting and only restore Pact Magic Slots on Short Rest
- [x] If the pact magic doesn't share a level with normal casting, still allow use of the `pact` snippet to use the higher level slot
- [x] Use the `pact` snippet to use Pact Magic when options are available

## Future Additions
- [ ] None Currently Planned
