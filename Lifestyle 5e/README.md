# Lifestyle

This is designed to be a downtime manager for a D&D5e Game. This Alias Currently Uses the Gritty Realism Rules found in the DMG.

The RPXP System Promotes acquiring RPXP through being active, but doesn't allow it's spending until actual XP is earned. 
This incentivizes RPing to earn the RPXP, and going out on missions and adventure to earn XP and be able to spend RPXP.
